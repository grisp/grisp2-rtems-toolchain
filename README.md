# GRiSP2 RTEMS Toolchain

This repository contains the basic tools and libraries to get an RTEMS system
running on GRiSP2. This includes:

* A `Makefile` that collects commands for building everything in this
  repository.
* The `rtems-source-builder` for building the toolchain (as a submodule).
* The bootloader `barebox` (as a submodule) and the necessary configuration.
* RTEMS and rtems-libbsd (as a submodule).
* A support library for some small GRiSP specific tasks `libgrisp` (as a
  submodule).
* A FDT (tested only with RTEMS)
* A RTEMS demo application.
* Some debugger scripts for a Lauterbach debugger (`t32`).

```

### Building

For building the basic stuff do a

    make install

This will build the toolchain, RTEMS, necessary libraries, the FDT, the
bootloader and basically everything that you need to create a RTEMS application
for the GRiSP2. Most of it will be installed to the `rtems/5` directory.
Exception: fdt and bootloader. The fdt will be at
`fdt/b-dtb/imx6ull-grisp2.dtb`. The bootloader image will be placed at
`external/barebox/images/barebox-phytec-phycore-imx6ull-grisp2.img`.

To build the demo application use a

    make demo

in the project root directory.

## How to Start an Application

The bootloader checks a number of boot devices. Among them is the SD-Card and
the eMMC. For these two the bootloader searches for an application image called
`zImage` and a device tree image called `oftree`. If these two files are found
the application will be booted.

For example to start the demo application you can use a FAT formatted SD-Card,
copy `fdt/b-dtb/imx6ull-grisp2.dtb` to `<SD-Path>/oftree` and copy
`demo/b-imx7/demo.zImage` to `<SD-Path>/zImage` and put the SD card in your
GRiSP. The bootloader will start this application.

Note that the eMMC has precedence. If the eMMC is written, the application from
eMMC will be started regardless of the SD content.

## Writing an Image to eMMC

:warning: :warning: :warning: :warning: :warning: :warning: :warning: :warning:
:warning: :warning: :warning: :warning: :warning: :warning: :warning: :warning:

Make absolutely sure the image that you write has a bootloader. Otherwise your
GRiSP2 might can't boot any more and you have to use the [recovery sequence][7].

:warning: :warning: :warning: :warning: :warning: :warning: :warning: :warning:

### Using an SD Card

1. Copy the image that you want onto an SD card. Put it in your GRiSP2.
1. Power up the GRiSP2.
1. Interrupt the boot loader when it outputs the `Hit m for menu or any key to
   stop autoboot:` line. You should drop into a shell with a
   `barebox@PHYTEC phyCORE-i.MX6 ULL SOM with eMMC:/` prompt.
1. Type `mmc1.probe=1` to start the eMMC detection.
1. Type `mmc0.probe=1` to start the SD detection.
1. You can now do a ls on your SD card: `ls /mnt/mmc0.0`
1. Copy your image to the eMMC, for big images, that needs quite some time.
    1. With a raw image, use command `cp /mnt/mmc/grisp2_emmc.img /dev/mmc1`.
    1. With a compressed image, use command `uncompress /mnt/mmc/grisp2_emmc.img.gz /dev/mmc1`.
1. Reset the system with `reset` on the shell. Barebox should now boot your
   application.

### Using TFTP

One way to write an Image to eMMC is via the bootloader:

1. Make sure you have a DHCP server and a TFTP (announced via DHCP). You can for
   example use `dnsmasq` with the following config for that:

        interface=eth0
        bootp-dynamic
        domain=my-pc.eb.localhost
        dhcp-authoritative
        log-dhcp
        expand-hosts
        local=/my-pc.eb.localhost/

        enable-tftp=eth0
        tftp-root=/srv/tftpboot/

        ##############################
        # GRiSP2
        dhcp-host=50:2d:f4:14:26:0b,GRiSP2Proto009,set:grisp2
        dhcp-range=tag:grisp2,172.24.0.130,172.24.0.140,255.255.255.0,2m

1. Prepare an image to write on your PC. That can be a raw image copied from an
   SD card or created with a loop-device on a Linux PC. Make sure that the image
   isn't too big (images >2GB maybe don't work depending on your tftp server).
   Also make sure that it has a `barebox` bootloader at the beginning (see (eMMC
   Image)[6]. The simplest possible image is to use the
   `barebox/barebox-phytec-phycore-imx6ull-emmc-512mb.img` directly.
1. Copy it to your tftp server directory with some simple name (e.g.
   `grisp2.img`).
1. Connect the network cable and power up the GRiSP2.
1. Interrupt the boot loader when it outputs the `Hit m for menu or any key to
   stop autoboot:` line. You should drop into a shell with a
   `barebox@PHYTEC phyCORE-i.MX6 ULL SOM with eMMC:/` prompt.
1. Type `mmc1.probe=1` to start the eMMC detection.
1. Type `dhcp` to get an IP address.
1. Now you have two alternatives. For both: If your tftp server isn't announced
   via DHCP use `global dev.eth0.serverip=172.24.0.99` to explicitly set your
   server.
    1. For small images that fit into RAM: Type `tftp grisp2.img` and write the
       received image to the eMMC with `cp grisp2.img /dev/mmc1`.
    1. For big images: Directly copy from the mount point for the tftp server.
       Note that tftp don's support listing files. Therefore a ls won't show you
       what's on the server. As long as there isn't an error, the tftp is
       mounted anyway. Use `cp /mnt/tftp/grisp2.img /dev/mmc1` for this method.
1. Wait for the image to be written. That can need quite some time.
1. Reset the system with `reset` on the shell. Barebox should now boot your
   application.

## Debugging

Debugging is either possible by connecting your favorite JTAG adapter to the
JTAG port. The connector pin out is the same as for the
[ARM Cortex M connectors][4].

Alternatively you can use the on-board FTDI to JTAG adapter. The adapter is
compatible to a [Floss-JTAG][3] supported by OpenOCD. The following text shows
how to use that on-board solution.

First build and install OpenOCD by running `make submodule-update` (if you
havn't build the toolchain before) and `make openocd`.

Make sure that your GRiSP2 starts some sample application with a sane FDT. The
debugger scripts will wait till the bootloader loads the FDT and the application
and then replaces the application with the one that you want to debug.

After that you should start openocd on one console using
`./debug/openocd/start-openocd.sh`. This starts an GDB-Server. Do not terminate
the process. You can then start a gdb that connects to the server using
`./debug/openocd/start-gdb.sh path/to/app.exe`. The script adds a `reset`
command to the normal gdb that restarts the target and reloads the application.
Note that for bigger applications, that might need quite some time.

### Notes for MacOS

To build OpenOCD on mac, you need texinfo 6.7 from brw but also add it to th path:

    export PATH=/usr/local/opt/texinfo/bin:$PATH
    make openocd

## Boot Loader

* [Instructions for updating the boot loader on GRiSP 2](doc/grisp2/bootloader-update.md)

### Recovery

Note: you should prefer to use Linux for this, on MacOS this works very
unreliably. A Linux VM with proper USB access is sufficient.

For some reason the boot loader has been damaged on your system? Here is the
solution:

* Build the `imx_uart` tool with `make imx_uart`.
* Set the `BOOT_MODE` Jumpers on your GRiSP2 so that the serial download mode
  will be started.
* Prepare to execute the following command. Don't execute it yet. Replace the
  `picocom ...` part with your preferred serial terminal application.

```
./rtems/5/bin/imx_uart -nN /dev/ttyGRiSP ./rtems/5/etc/imx-loader.d/mx6ull_usb_work.conf barebox/barebox-phytec-phycore-imx6ul-emmc-512mb.img && picocom -l -b 115200 /dev/ttyGRiSP
```

* Power-Cycle or Power up the GRiSP2. A reset is not enough!
* Press the reset button and execute the prepared command in the next seconds.
* Wait till `imx_uart` finishes and a `barebox` starts. That will need quite a
  bit of time (nearly a minute).
* Interrupt the `barebox` start when it tells you to
  `Hit m for menu or any to stop autoboot:    1`
* Use the eMMC image from `barebox/grisp2_emmc.img.gz` and
  follow the steps from the section [Writing an Image to eMMC][5]. The image
  contains the initial factory image, with barebox, a first partition with
  the grisp erlang demo and an uninitialized second partition.
* Power down the GRiSP2 and remove the `BOOT_MODE` Jumpers.
* Power up the GRiSP2. You should now get a Bootloader again. Interrupt the boot
  when it tells you to `Hit m for menu or any to stop autoboot:`
* Now you can copy new files onto the partition (mounted at `/mnt/emmc`).
  If you want to copy from an SD Card you have to do a `mmc0.probe=1` first.
  Then you can access the SD Card in `/mnt/mmc`.

## eMMC Image

The eMMC has to contain the `barebox` bootloader. Basically that means that you
copy the image from `barebox/barebox-phytec-phycore-imx6ull-emmc-512mb.img` to
address 0x0 of your image before you create your partitions. Otherwise there is
nothing special when creating the image.

The following is an example for creating an SD image with Linux. Please be
careful when partitioning the file and double or better tripple check that
everything is set up correctly with the loop device and that you use the correct
loop device. Otherwise you might destroy your Linux installation with these
commands.

```
dd if=/dev/zero of=grisp2_emmc.img bs=1M count=128
dd if=barebox/barebox-phytec-phycore-imx6ul-emmc-512mb.img of=grisp2_emmc.img conv=notrunc
sudo modprobe loop
sudo losetup /dev/loop4 grisp2_emmc.img
echo 'type=83' | sudo sfdisk /dev/loop4
sudo partprobe /dev/loop4
sudo mkfs.vfat -n "GRISP2" -s 8 /dev/loop4p1
sudo mount /dev/loop4p1 some/mount/point
sudo cp demo/b-imx7/demo.zImage some/mount/point/zImage
sudo cp fdt/b-dtb/imx6ul-grisp2.dtb some/mount/point/oftree
sudo cp -r demo/loader some/mount/point/loader
sudo umount some/mount/point
sudo losetup -d /dev/loop4
